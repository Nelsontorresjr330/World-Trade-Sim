## World Sim Game 

So long as the input files setup properly and their file locations in country_scheduler and main are correct, the program should execute fairly easily

To run multiple schedules at once, get to the directory with the program and run `sudo python3 main.py`, the `sudo` will occasionally prompt you for your password, this is necessary for permissions to write the output files.

The program should then run, there are 4 initial input questions asked by the program (Max Depth, Frontier Size, Max Multiplier & No. of Schedules)

To run the experimental, faster version, the command is `sudo python3 fast.py`
